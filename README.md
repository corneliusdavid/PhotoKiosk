# PhotoKiosk

This project was designed as a follow-up to [Photo Kiosk Generator](https://github.com/corneliusdavid/PhotoKioskGenerator), a Windows program that reads data from a spreadsheet and builds static HTML/CSS pages that can be displayed on a computer to show a list of photos. The goal of this one is to provide the same end result, but be a full-functioning web site, providing online maintainence while still being able to export the same set of web pages for those situations where an isolated computer is utilized.

It is built with C# in Visual Studio 2017 using ASP.NET 5 MVC and Entity Framework 6.
